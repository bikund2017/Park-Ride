## Migration Guide

### For Developers

The new structure is backward compatible but uses modern React patterns:

```jsx
// Old: App.js with inline components
// New: App.js with modular components

// Import new components:
import Header from './components/Header';
import Sidebar from './components/Sidebar';

// Usage remains similar but cleaner:
<Header stats={stats} />
<Sidebar data={data} />
```

### Key Differences

1. **Tabbed Interface**: Instead of scrolling, use tabs
2. **Separate Components**: Header and Sidebar are now separate
3. **Better Props**: Cleaner prop passing
4. **Modern Styling**: Uses CSS modules pattern

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Filter/Search** - Add search functionality in sidebar
2. **Dark Mode** - Add theme toggle
3. **Settings Panel** - User preferences
4. **Export Data** - Download transit information
5. **Favorites** - Save frequently viewed routes
