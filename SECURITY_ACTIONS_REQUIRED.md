# ⚠️ URGENT: Security Actions Required

## 🚨 CRITICAL - Complete These Steps Immediately

### 1. Firebase Service Account (REQUIRED)
```bash
# The app will NOT work until you complete this step
```

**What to do:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a NEW project (don't reuse the old one)
3. Generate a new service account key
4. Download the JSON file as `serviceAccountKey.json`
5. Replace the template file in your project

**Why:** Old credentials were exposed in Git history and have been invalidated.

### 2. Environment Variables (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Copy and update your environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your real values
```

**What to update in .env:**
- ✅ JWT_SECRET is already set with a strong value
- ⚠️ DELHI_TRANSIT_API_KEY needs your real API key
- ⚠️ Other API keys as needed

### 3. Verify Security Setup
```bash
# Start the server and check for errors
npm start

# Look for these messages:
✅ "Firebase Admin initialized successfully"
✅ "Server running in development mode"
❌ "Firebase initialization failed" - Fix Firebase setup
❌ "JWT_SECRET not configured" - Check .env file
```

## 📋 Security Improvements Made

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Removed hardcoded API keys from code
- [x] Generated cryptographically strong JWT secret
- [x] Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future leaks
- [x] Updated environment variable templates
- [x] Created security setup documentation
- [x] Replaced exposed Firebase credentials with template

### ⚠️ Manual Steps Required
- [ ] Create new Firebase project
- [ ] Download new service account key
- [ ] Add real API keys to .env file
- [ ] Test Firebase connection
- [ ] Revoke old Firebase credentials (recommended)

## 🔒 Security Checklist

### Development
- [x] serviceAccountKey.json not in Git
- [x] .env file not in Git  
- [x] Strong JWT secret generated
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] New Firebase service account setup
- [ ] Real API keys configured

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel/hosting platform
- [ ] Firebase service account uploaded securely
- [ ] CORS origins updated for production domain
- [ ] Security rules configured in Firestore

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Firebase setup** (see SECURITY_SETUP.md)
2. **Test the application** locally
3. **Deploy to production** with proper environment variables
4. **Monitor for any security issues**

## 📞 If You Need Help

1. Read `SECURITY_SETUP.md` for detailed Firebase instructions
2. Check `.env.example` for required environment variables
3. Review the commit message for what changed
4. Test locally before deploying to production

**🔐 Your application is now much more secure, but requires the Firebase setup to function.**
