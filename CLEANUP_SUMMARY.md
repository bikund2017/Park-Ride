# Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all unused code that was removed from the Park-Ride- project.

## Files Removed

### Authentication System (Unused)
- **middleware/auth.js** - Authentication middleware with `protect` and `admin` functions that were never used
- **models/User.js** - User model for authentication that was never actually used
- **routes/auth.js** - Auth routes (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`) that were imported but not utilized
- **Empty `/api/auth/me` endpoint** removed from server.js

### Duplicate API Handlers (Vercel serverless functions not used)
- **api/health.js** - Duplicated the `/api/health` endpoint already in server.js
- **api/reports.js** - Duplicated the `/api/reports` endpoint already in server.js

### Unused Utilities
- **utils/morganConfig.js** - Morgan logging middleware that was a no-op (just passed through)

### Unused Service Functions
- **services/transitAPI.js:fetchParkingData()** - Function was exported but never called anywhere

## Empty Directories Removed
- `middleware/`
- `models/`
- `routes/`
- `api/`

## Dependencies Removed

### Production Dependencies
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing for unused auth system
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT token generation for unused auth system
- `express-validator` - Validation for unused auth routes

### Development Dependencies
- `morgan` - HTTP request logger (unused no-op wrapper)
- `eslint-config-airbnb` - Unused ESLint config
- `eslint-plugin-import` - Unused ESLint plugin
- `eslint-plugin-jest` - Unused ESLint plugin (no tests)
- `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` - Unused ESLint plugin (server-side only uses these)
- `eslint-plugin-react` - Unused ESLint plugin (React is in client folder)

**Total packages removed:** ~402 packages (including sub-dependencies)

## Code Changes

### server.js
- Removed `authRoutes` import
- Removed `/api/auth` route registration
- Removed `/api/auth/me` endpoint
- Removed `morganMiddleware` import and usage
- Removed `PARKING_API_KEY` reference from transit info endpoint

### services/transitAPI.js
- Removed unused `fetchParkingData()` function
- Updated default export to use `getAllTransitData` alias

### package.json
- Removed 3 production dependencies
- Removed 6 development dependencies

## Impact
- **Cleaner codebase** - Removed ~800+ lines of unused code
- **Smaller bundle** - Reduced node_modules size by ~402 packages
- **Better maintainability** - Less confusion about what code is actually being used
- **Faster installation** - Fewer packages to download and install

## What Was Kept
- ESLint and basic config (still configured and functional)
- All active features: parking lots, transit vehicles, reports, favorites
- Firebase integration (actively used for data storage)
- All client-side code

## Testing Recommendation
After these changes, you should:
1. Test that the server starts correctly: `npm start`
2. Test all API endpoints: reports, favorites, transit-info, health
3. Test the client-side application functionality
4. Consider adding the authentication system back if needed in the future
