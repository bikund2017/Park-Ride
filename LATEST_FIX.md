# ðŸŽ¯ Latest Fix Applied - What Changed

## The Problem
Vercel was looking for a Node.js entrypoint because it didn't know this is a **static site + serverless functions** setup.

## The Solution
Updated `vercel.json` to use **legacy `builds` configuration**:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "client/dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/((?!api/).*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How This Works

### 1. Static Build (`@vercel/static-build`)
- Tells Vercel this is a **static site** (not Node.js app)
- Runs `npm run build` or `npm run vercel-build` from root
- Outputs to `client/dist/`
- Serves HTML/CSS/JS as static files

### 2. Automatic API Function Detection
- Vercel **automatically** detects `/api/*.js` files
- Each becomes a serverless function
- No explicit configuration needed!

### 3. Routing
- Non-API routes (`/((?!api/).*)`) â†’ `/index.html` (React Router SPA)
- API routes â†’ Serverless functions (auto-detected)

## Expected Build Process

```
1. Clone repo
2. Install root dependencies (npm install)
   â†’ Provides firebase-admin, faker, etc. for API functions
3. Run "npm run vercel-build"
   â†’ Executes: cd client && npm ci && npm run build
   â†’ Creates: client/dist/
4. Detect /api/*.js files
   â†’ Creates serverless functions
5. Deploy static files (client/dist/) + functions (/api/)
```

## Testing After Deployment

Wait ~1 minute, then test:

```bash
# Test API health
curl https://park-ride-new1.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected: JSON with {status: "operational", ...}

# Test transit data
curl https://park-ride-new1.vercel.app/api/transit-data

# Expected: JSON with {parkingLots: [...], vehicles: [...]}

# Test frontend
curl -I https://park-ride-new1.vercel.app/

# Expected: HTTP/2 200
```

## Why This Should Work Now

âœ… `@vercel/static-build` tells Vercel it's a static site  
âœ… `distDir: "client/dist"` points to built React files  
âœ… `npm run vercel-build` builds the client correctly  
âœ… `/api/` folder will be auto-detected as serverless functions  
âœ… Routes properly separate SPA from API  

The key difference: We're explicitly using `@vercel/static-build` instead of letting Vercel auto-detect (which was failing).
