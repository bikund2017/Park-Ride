# Report Markers Implementation

## Overview
Added functionality to display user-submitted reports as markers on the map.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Added GET /api/reports Endpoint (server.js)
- **Location**: Lines 392-417
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all submitted reports from Firestore
- **Features**:
  - Orders reports by timestamp (most recent first)
  - Limits to 100 most recent reports
  - Returns report data with formatted timestamps
  - Handles errors gracefully

**API Endpoint**:
```
GET /api/reports
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "reports": [
    {
      "id": "report-id",
      "location": [28.6139, 77.2090],
      "description": "Parking is full here",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "submittedAt": "1/15/2024, 10:30:00 AM"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend - Added Report Markers (MapView.js)
- **Added Report Icon**: Grey marker icon to distinguish from other markers
- **State Management**: Added `reports` state to store fetched reports
- **Data Fetching**: 
  - Fetches reports when component mounts
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Map Rendering**: Displays report markers with popups showing:
  - ⚠️ User Report label
  - Description
  - Submission timestamp
  - Location coordinates

**Icon Color**: Grey (`marker-icon-2x-grey.png`)

### 3. Mock Database Support (firebase.js)
- **Location**: Lines 50-59
- **Purpose**: Added `orderBy` support to mock database
- **Note**: Prevents crashes if Firebase is not configured

## How It Works

### Flow:
1. User submits a report via POST /api/report
2. Report is stored in Firestore `reports` collection
3. Frontend fetches reports via GET /api/reports
4. Reports are displayed as grey markers on the map
5. Clicking a marker shows report details in a popup

### Visual Markers:
- 🟢 **Green**: Parking lots with good availability
- 🟡 **Orange**: Parking lots with limited availability
- 🔴 **Red**: Parking lots nearly full
- 🔵 **Blue**: Metro stations
- 🟠 **Orange**: Bus stops
- 🟣 **Purple**: Train stations
- ⚪ **Grey**: User reports (NEW)

## User Experience

### For Regular Users:
- See all submitted reports on the map
- Click any report marker to read details
- Reports auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- New reports appear automatically without refresh

### For Reporting Users:
- When you submit a report, it appears on the map as a grey marker
- Your report is visible to all users
- Help others by sharing information about parking, traffic, etc.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Submit a test report**:
   - Click on the map to select a location
   - Enter a description and submit
   - A grey marker should appear at that location

2. **View existing reports**:
   - Check the map for any grey markers
   - Click on a grey marker to see report details
   - Reports refresh every 30 seconds

3. **Verify API endpoint**:
   - Test GET /api/reports endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3002/api/reports
     ```

## Files Modified

1. `/server.js` - Added GET /api/reports endpoint
2. `/client/src/components/MapView.js` - Added report fetching and markers
3. `/firebase.js` - Enhanced mock database support

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Filter reports by date range
- [ ] Add report categories (traffic, parking, incidents)
- [ ] Implement report moderations
- [ ] Add "Upvote" feature for useful reports
- [ ] Show report count in sidebar
- [ ] Add report clustering for dense areas
- [ ] Implement report expiration

## Status
✅ Implemented and ready to use
